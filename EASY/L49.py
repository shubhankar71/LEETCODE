Super Pow

Your task is to calculate ab mod 1337 where a is a positive integer and b is an extremely large positive integer given in the form of an array.

Example 1:
Input: a = 2, b = [3]
Output: 8

Example 2:
Input: a = 2, b = [1,0]
Output: 1024

Example 3:
Input: a = 1, b = [4,3,3,8,5,2]
Output: 1

class Solution:
    def superPow(self, a, b):
        MOD = 1337
        result = 1

        for digit in b:
            result = (pow(result, 10, MOD) * pow(a, digit, MOD)) % MOD

        return result
